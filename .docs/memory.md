## Key Learning
- This MCP server requires token as direct parameter in tool calls
- Environment variable ${input:lifx_token_new} doesn't auto-inject
- Need to pass actual token string to each mcp_lifxmcp_* tool call
- Selector "label:Lenlight" works perfectly for targeting specific light

## Available Tools (now working)
- mcp_lifxmcp_list_lights: ✅ WORKING
- mcp_lifxmcp_set_state: ✅ WORKING (just used successfully)
- mcp_lifxmcp_*_effect: Ready for effects
